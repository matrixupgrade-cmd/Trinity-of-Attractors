Structure of the Repository
1. Universal Attractor Metamorphosis      
emergent_order.lean
01 02 03 04

What it proves:

A 2D discrete dynamical system where parameters evolve via a gradient-based learner.

System initially in a chaotic regime (no stable Nash equilibrium) eventually enters a subcritical regime with bounded trajectories.

Persistent positive entropy emerges, proving high information content in the attractor.

Formalized properties: subcritical, bounded trajectories, positive entropy, meta-iteration of learner.

Applications: Can be interpreted as a minimal model for adaptive systems where feedback mechanisms stabilize chaotic interactions.

2. Newton-Like Coupling Toy Systems
emergent_geometry_extended.lean

What it proves:

Geometry emerges from discrete coupled interactions resembling Newton’s cradle.

Demonstrates how local couplings generate structured motion and predictable emergent patterns.

Applications: Insights into mechanical systems, energy flow, and geometric emergence from local interactions.

3. PDE & Topology Systems
allPDEsareTensionSpiders.lean
allTopologiesareTensionSpiders.lean

What it proves:

Continuous coupling systems formalized via PDEs.

Tension spiders encode information propagation across the system.

Shows how topological structures arise naturally from multi-component interactions.

Applications: Can inform physics, city networks, or complex systems analysis where flow and connectivity are central.

Using These Lean Files

For AI:

Lean files are fully machine-readable and provide explicit proofs.

AI can extract patterns, invariants, and causal relationships from the formalization.

For Humans:

Can use Lean to experiment with parameter variations and trajectories.

Provides intuitive insights into markets, physics, urban dynamics, or any coupled system.

Tension spiders help visualize and interpret information flow through these systems.

Humans can plug these lean files in LLM A.i.  and get insite into the world around them viewed from emergent order from systems where parts intersact back and forth.
