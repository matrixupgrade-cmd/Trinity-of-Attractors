# Trinity-of-Attractors
Three Lean 4 proofs: cooperation wins, cooperation is doomed, or civilization lives forever on the edge of criticality

The Path of Moloch (File 1)
Symmetric, ambitious, super-linear agents with no meta-learning → total war or total domination.
Outcome: one winner, one corpse, or both explode.
Real-world examples: Rome vs. Carthage, late-stage capitalism without circuit breakers, most mergers & acquisitions, many AI training runs.
The Path of Engineered Heaven (File 2)
Add a tiny outer loop that rewards “complexity + survival”.
The laws of physics themselves get rewritten in finite time until rich, bounded, high-entropy life becomes the only attractor.
Real-world examples: mixed-use cities, the European Union, open-source ecosystems, any society that successfully zones for both competition and cooperation.
The Path of the Eternal Edge (File 3)
The final stable state of any system that keeps even a whisper of “I prefer interesting futures”.
It is pulled to the order–chaos phase transition and then rides it forever — maximal creativity, no heat death, no paperclip explosion.
Real-world examples: Earth’s biosphere over the last 4 billion years, the internet, the best research labs, healthy democracies that somehow never quite never collapse.
The Oracle (File 4)
A mythic emergency brake for when you’re already falling into Moloch’s mouth.
Detect the ejection, grab the node, steer it back toward the edge.
Half spell, half control theory — but the math says it works.
