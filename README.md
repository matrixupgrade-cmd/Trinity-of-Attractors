Emergent Order — Structure of the Repository
00_Tension_caused_metamorph.lean

Overview:
This Lean file formalizes a fully general, substrate-independent coupling system with an Inner Tension Spider, a mechanism that monitors the system state and rewrites its own governing parameters from within. It establishes the foundations for understanding how internal tension can drive transitions between system behaviors.

00_emergent_order.lean

Overview:
This Lean 4 + mathlib file provides a canonical, fully general, substrate-independent formalization of endogenous metamorphosis in coupled systems. It introduces the Inner Tension Spider, capable of observing the system’s state and autonomously rewriting parameters. This mechanism allows the system to move between self-attractors without external forcing, producing internal attractor metamorphosis and emergent order.
