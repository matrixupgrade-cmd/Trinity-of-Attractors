Overview:
This Lean file formalizes a fully general, substrate-independent coupling system with an Inner Tension Spider, a mechanism that monitors the system state and rewrites its own governing parameters from within.


00_emergent_order.lean

Overview:
This Lean 4 + mathlib file provides a fully general, substrate-independent formalization of endogenous metamorphosis in coupled systems. It introduces the concept of an Inner Tension Spider, a mechanism that observes the system’s state and rewrites its own governing parameters from within. This allows a system to move between self-attractors without external forcing, producing internal attractor metamorphosis.
