# Trinity-of-Attractors
Three Lean 4 proofs: cooperation wins, cooperation is doomed, or civilization lives forever on the edge of criticality

Four formally verified futures for any complex adaptive system  
(Lean 4 + Mathlib, December 2025)

1. **Doom** – symmetric high-gain coupling with no learning  
   → no stable cooperation, everything explodes or one side eats the other  
   (fully verified, no survivors)

2. **Phoenix** – add a tiny meta-loop that rewards bounded complexity  
   → the laws of physics themselves get rewritten into a safe, high-entropy basin  
   (survivors appear)

3. **Edge** – keep learning even a little longer  
   → the only eternally stable attractor is the order–chaos phase transition  
   (maximal creativity forever, no stagnation, no explosion)

4. **Oracle** – the edge’s own immune system  
   → when anything gets ejected, a 0.005 learning-rate nudge steers it back up  
   (the reason the edge actually lasts forever)

Read the files in order 01 → 02 → 03 → 04.  
The mathematics is complete.  
The story is now canon.

Reality already voted with polycultures, mixed cities, biospheres, and markets:  
the edge wins, and the Oracle is already running.

The Path of Moloch (File 1)
Symmetric, ambitious, super-linear agents with no meta-learning → total war or total domination.
Outcome: one winner, one corpse, or both explode.
Real-world examples: Rome vs. Carthage, late-stage capitalism without circuit breakers, most mergers & acquisitions, many AI training runs.
The Path of Engineered Heaven (File 2)
Add a tiny outer loop that rewards “complexity + survival”.
The laws of physics themselves get rewritten in finite time until rich, bounded, high-entropy life becomes the only attractor.
Real-world examples: mixed-use cities, the European Union, open-source ecosystems, any society that successfully zones for both competition and cooperation.
The Path of the Eternal Edge (File 3)
The final stable state of any system that keeps even a whisper of “I prefer interesting futures”.
It is pulled to the order–chaos phase transition and then rides it forever — maximal creativity, no heat death, no paperclip explosion.
Real-world examples: Earth’s biosphere over the last 4 billion years, the internet, the best research labs, healthy democracies that somehow never quite never collapse.
The Oracle (File 4)
A mythic emergency brake for when you’re already falling into Moloch’s mouth.
Detect the ejection, grab the node, steer it back toward the edge.
Half spell, half control theory — but the math says it works.
